# Henry's BlackJack!
### Welcome to my BlackJack Game!
##### BlackJack is a Luck/Skill based card game involving a dealer and a player. The goal of the game is get your card values as close to 21 as possible. Whoever's card value is closest to, or equals 21 is the winner. You will start by being given the option to bet money, then deal.  ![](https://i.imgur.com/EDcsFvo.png) The player and the dealer will be given 2 cards. ![](https://i.imgur.com/VqJOZ7t.png)The dealer will start with a 1 card face up, the other face down, to be revealed once the player makes a decision to "stand". ![](https://i.imgur.com/9w7Bt1v.png)Once, you have dealt, you may "hit" to request another card but be careful not to go over 21, if you do, you Lose!  The dealer must hit on 17, and will stand on anything higher. That's about it! Have fun!
