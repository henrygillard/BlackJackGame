Store elements on the page as variables that will be accessed in code. 

Upon loading the app should
    1. initialize the state variables
        - this should initialize the rendering of the bet options
        - initialize the betting power as $500
        - initialize the rendering of the cards face down
        - initialize a play game button (deal)
    2. Render those values to the page
        - will need to render the cards face down
        - render the deal button to display while the game is not in progress.

    3. wait for the user to place bet

    4. Handle the player placing a bet

    - 2 sets of chips?
    - 1 value is $50 the other is $100

    5. wait for user to hit deal button

    6. Once the play button is hit
        - render the cards randomly
        - 2 cards for player, 1 card for dealer, (order should be player, dealer, player or all at the same time?) wait for player to make decision



    7. Handle the player making a decision (hit or stand)
        -hit
            
            - player takes cards 
            - game waits for another choice (hit/stand) 
            - if cards reach over 21, player loses
            - if 21, game checks for dealer tie, if not, player wins
            
        - stand
            - same logic applies to dealer except
            - dealer automatically stands if card sum is between 17-20
            - if 21, game checks for player tie, if not, dealer wins

            
        
    8. Logic checks for game winner
        - if player wins
        - chip sum gets updated to bet * 2
        - display win message
        - render deal button again

    9. Game waits for user to click deal button
